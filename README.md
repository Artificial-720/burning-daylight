## Features

- **Sunburn Damage**: Direct exposure to sunlight causes damageâ€”find shade or go underground to stay safe.
  - Damage duration and intensity are fully configurable.
- **Nighttime Safety**: Reduced damage at night. This is configurable through settings.
- **Weather Protection**: Rainy or stormy weather diminishes sunlight. This is configurable through settings.
- **Grace Period**:
  - Players start with a 5-minute grace period (default), during which they are immune to sunburn damage.
  - Grace periods can be applied on the first join or upon respawning, with customizable start/end messages.
- **Customizable Damage Prevention**:
  - Sunburn damage can be prevented in specific dimensions, such as the Nether or the End.
  - Fire Resistance potions can also grant immunity if enabled in the configuration.
- **Armor Protection**:
  - Leather armor is the default protective gear, reducing damage by 25% per piece (full leather armor negates 100% of damage).
  - Other armor types (iron, gold, diamond, netherite) can be configured for protection through the settings.
  - Fire Protection enchantments further reduce damage.
- **Daytime Durability Damage**:
  - Armor takes durability damage from sun exposure during the day (default).

- **Exempt Players**: Specific players can be exempted from sunburn damage via configuration.
